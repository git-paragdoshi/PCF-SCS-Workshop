= Dynamic Configuration Loading with Spring Cloud Services - Config Server

In this lab we'll utilize Spring Boot and Spring Cloud to configure our application from a configuration dynamically retrieved from a git repository. We'll then deploy it to Pivotal Cloud Foundry and auto-provision an instance of a configuration server using Pivotal Spring Cloud Services.

== Import Starter Project in Eclipse

in your git clone directory, there will be a sub-directory named 'starter-project/spring-config'. In that directory, there will be a zip archive file named 'SCSApp.zip'. Un-zip that file into any directory. After un-zipping that file, import it as a Maven project in Eclipse by following these steps:

. Start Eclipse and use the File -> Import ->Maven ->Existing Maven Projects option:

+
image::../../Common/images/eclipse-import-project.png[]

. In the project selection step, navigate to your directory where you un-zipped the file and select 'SCSApp':

+
image::../../Common/images/eclipse-project-selection.png[] 

. Click Finish. The project should be imported without any errors. Make sure your Eclipse Java Compiler is set to greater than 1.5 :

+
image::../../Common/images/eclipse-project-imported.png[] 


. Click on menu option Run -> Run Configuration -> Maven option. Click on 'New Launch Configuration icon' and create a Maven launch configuration with *clean* and *package* goals. Select SCSApp project as the Base Directory. Click Finish and you should have a successful build. A new scsapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar should be created in /target folder :
+
image::../../Common/images/eclipse-build-successful.png[]

. Open the manifest.yml file and change the app name to include your unique user name and remove the buildpack attribute:
+
image::../../Common/images/eclipse-manifest-uniquename.png[]


== Push to CF

. Navigate to the project directory on the command prompt and run the 'cf push' command:

. Navigate to your scsapp in a browser and you should see a simple html page output, similar to the one below:

+
image::../../Common/images/eclipse-scsapp-index-page.png[]

== Add ability to read dynamic Value

Now we will set the groundwork of reading dynamic value in our application. Make the following changes:

. In  */main/src/java/com.example.ServiceController.java*, add the following snippet of code above the index() REST service method which will create a variable _greeting and store a default value of "Hi". Make sure to import *org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value*.

+
[source, java]
-----
@Value("${greeting:Hi}")
	private String _greeting;
-----

. In */main/src/java/com.example.ServiceController.java*, update the index() REST service method to store the value of _greeting in the model object:

+
[source, java]
-----
model.addAttribute("greeting", _greeting);
-----

. The complete */main/src/java/com.example.ServiceController.java* will look like this:
+
[source, java]
-----
package com.example;


import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;

@Controller
public class ServicesController {

	@Value("${greeting:Hi}")
	private String _greeting;

	
	@RequestMapping("/")
	public String index(HttpServletRequest request, Model model) throws Exception {
		model.addAttribute("greeting", _greeting);
		return "index";
	}
}
-----

. Override the default value of "Hi" in the */src/main/resources/applications.properties* by adding this line:

+
[source, properties]
-----
greeting="Hello"
-----

. Modify the */src/main/resources/template/index.html* file with the following snippet:

+
[source, html]
-----
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
		Value returned for greeting is: <span th:text="${greeting}"> </span>
	</div>
</div>
-----
+
Complete */src/main/resources/template/index.html* file:

+
[source, html]
-----
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<body>
	<div class="container" role="main">

		<div class="page-header">
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h1>Welcome to Spring Cloud Services Lab!</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="row ">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>The purpose of this application is to show Spring Cloud Services features.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				Value returned for greeting is: <span th:text="${greeting}"> </span>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</body>

</html>

-----

. Run the *clean* and *package* task of Maven, go to the command prompt and *cf push* the application. Refreshing the browser should show the dynamic value of greeting:
+
image::../../Common/images/eclipse-scsapp-greeting-hello.png[]


== Add Spring Config functionality
Now we will add the functionality to read the 'greeting' value from a git repo that is backed by Spring Cloud Config service. Make the following changes to the application:

. Open your Maven POM file (*pom.xml*) and add the following dependencies to enable SCS and actuator end-point so we can see the environment values returned for the config service:

+
[source, xml]
-----
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-services-dependencies</artifactId>
	<version>1.4.1.RELEASE</version>
	<type>pom</type>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
	<version>Brixton.SR7</version>
	<type>pom</type>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-commons</artifactId>
	<version>1.1.8.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-config-client</artifactId>
	<version>1.4.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

-----

. When we introduced the Spring Cloud Services Starter Config Client dependency Spring Security will also be included (Config servers will be protected by OAuth2).  However, this will also enable basic authentication to all our service endpoints.  Add the following configuration to */main/resources/application.properties*:

+
---------------------------------------------------------------------
security.basic.enabled=false
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. We'll also want to give our Spring Boot App a name so that it can lookup application-specific configuration from the config server later.  Add the following configuration to */main/resources/application.properties*:

+
---------------------------------------------------------------------
spring.application.name=scsapp
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. To simplify working with the endpoint for this lab, we will turn off additional security for the health endpoint. Add the following to */main/resources/application.properties*:

+
------
management.security.enabled=false
------

. Complete */main/resources/application.properties*:
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------
greeting="Hello"
security.basic.enabled=false
spring.application.name=scsapp
management.security.enabled=false
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. Next step is to create the Spring Config Server service instance and bind it to our application. To create the config server instance, navigate to Marketplace in your App Manager and click on 'Config Server' service:
+
image::../../Common/images/marketplace-config-server.png[]

. In the resulting details page, select the _standard_, single tenant plan.  give it a unique name, select the 'workspace' space that you've been using to push all your applications.  At this time you don't need to select a application to bind to the service:
+
image::../../Common/images/create-config-server-instance.png[]

. After we create the service instance you'll be redirected to your _Space_ landing page that lists your apps and services.  The config server is deployed on-demand and will take a few moments to deploy.  

+
image::../../Common/images/config-server-initializing.png[]


. Once the messsage _The Service Instance is Initializing_ disappears click on the service you provisioned.  Select the manage link towards the top of the resulting screen to view the instance id and a JSON document with a single element, count, which validates that the instance provisioned correctly:

+
image::../../Common/images/config-server-initialized.png[]

. We now need to update the service instance with our GIT repository information.  Using the cloudfoundry CLI execute the following update service command:
+
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cf update-service pdoshi-config-server -c '{"git": { "uri": "https://github.com/git-paragdoshi/config-repo" } }'
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. The command will provide the following update:

+
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Updating service instance pdoshi-config-server as pdoshi@pivotal.io...
OK

Update in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service pdoshi-config-server' to check operation status.
pdoshi@Parags-MacBook-Pro:~/start-project/SCSApp$ cf service pdoshi-config-server

---------------------------------------------------------------------


. Refresh you Config Server management page and you will see the following message.  Wait until the screen refreshes and the service is reintialized:

+
image::../../Common/images/config-server-reinitializing.png[]

. After the service completes the the re-initialzing, you should see the the git uri updated on the config page:

+
image::../../Common/images/config-git-uri-updated.png[]

. We will now bind our application to our config-server within our Cloudfoundry deployment manifest.  Add these 2 entries to the bottom of *manifest.yml*
+
[source, yml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 services:
  - pdoshi-config-server
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. Complete manifest file will look like this:

+
image::../../Common/images/config-manifest-entry.png[]



. Run the Maven *package* command for your application and *cf push* the application from the command prompt. Watch for the 'Binding service..' status in the cf push output. It will look something similar to this:

+
[source, bash]
-----
:
Binding service pdoshi-config-server to app pdoshi-scsapp in org PapaJohns / space workshop as pdoshi@pivotal.io...
OK
:
-----

== Run Application

. Access your application in the browser and now it should show the 'greeting' value from the config repo:

+
image::../../Common/images/config-success-message.png[]

. Another way to check the values coming from the config service is to use the /env endpoint that is provided by Spring Actuator. Hitting this end point for your application, will result in an output similar to this:

+
image::../../Common/images/config-env-endpoint.png[]

. What just happened??  A Spring component within the Spring Cloud Starter Config Client module called a _service connector_ automatically detected that there was a Cloud Config service bound into the application.  The service connector configured the application automatically to connect to the cloud config server and download the configuration and wire it into the application

. If you navigate to the GIT repo we specified for our configuration, https://github.com/git-paragdoshi/config-repo, you'll see a file named *scsapp.yml*.  This filename is the same as our spring.application.name value for our Boot application.  The configuration is read from this file, in our case the following property:
+
[source, yaml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
greeting: Hi from Git !
---------------------------------------------------------------------

== Dynamically refreshing Git repo values in application

. Let's update the value of greeting in the git repo and check if that is dynamically updated in our application. As can be seen below, I have updated the git repo value of greeting to 'Hi Refreshed!':

+
image::../../Common/images/config-git-refreshed.png[]

. Refresh your application page in the browser to check if the updated value is retrieved from git by Spring Config.
+
image::../../Common/images/config-app-not-refreshed.png[]

. As can be seen the value was not updated. Why not?? Because the Config value were retrieved at startup and stored in the Spring bean. There was no way for Spring to know that the value have been refreshed in the remote Git repo. 

 To refresh the values without starting up the app, we need to utilize a Spring Actuator endpoint named /refresh and also add an annotation to our Controller class so that the value can be refreshed dynamically. 

. Add @RefreshScope annotation to the ServiceController.java:

+
[source, java]
-----
@Controller
@RefreshScope
public class ServicesController {

-----
. Run Maven task *clean* and *package*. Go to the command prompt and do  *cf push*. After the application is pushed, visit the application in the browser. It will show the updated *greeting* value - we will dynamically change and refresh it shortly.

+
image::../../Common/images/config-app-value-after-restart.png[]

. Now, lets update the Git repo value to 'Hi Refreshed Again!' :
+
image::../../Common/images/config-app-value-refreshed-again.png[]

. Go to the command prompt and run curl command (Download cURL if not already installed on your machine: https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) or you can run this command in PostMan (Download link: https://www.getpostman.com) too. Output is shown for both methods:
+
cURL:
+
[source, bash]
-----
pdoshi@Parags-MacBook-Pro:~/start-project/SCSApp$ curl -X POST http://pdoshi-scsapp.cfapps.io/refresh 
["config.client.version","greeting"]pdoshi@Parags-MacBook-Pro:~/start-project/SCSApp$
-----
+
Postman (notice the Status: 200 OK):
+
image::../../Common/images/config-refresh-with-postman.png[]

. Now go ahead and refresh your application page in the browser and it should show you the updated git value (without restarting your application):
+
image::../../Common/images/config-success-with-refresh.png[]

. Congrats! You have successfully refreshed your git repo values dynamically! Complete source code for this lab can be found in the *SCSApp-complete.zip* file in */complete-project/spring-config* folder.

. Next we'll learn how to register our service with a service registry and load balance requests using Spring Cloud components.
